# No difference between a simple majority quorum and a simple majority quorum
# joint with an empty majority quorum. (This is asserted for all datadriven tests
# by the framework, so we don't dwell on it more).
#
# Note that by specifying cfgj explicitly we tell the test harness to treat the
# input as a joint quorum and not a majority quorum. If we didn't specify
# cfgj=zero the test would pass just the same, but it wouldn't be exercising the
# joint quorum path.
